This summer project, organized by MijnLeuven, provided young creatives with the opportunity to immerse themselves in their own artistic endeavors within a supportive studio space. Participants were encouraged to explore their unique interests and develop personal projects, resulting in a diverse array of creative works. Hazel chose to focus on crochet, crafting three balaclavas, each one symbolically inspired by the natural elements of earth, water, and sand.

     Through careful selection of textures and colors, she represented the essence of each element in her designs. Adding a personal touch, Hazel also took on the role of photographer, capturing each piece in a series of self-styled photographs that emphasized the character and aesthetic of her work.
